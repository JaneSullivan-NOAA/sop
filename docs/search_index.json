There are two databases in particular that youll want access to. AFSC and AKFIN. AKFIN is the Alaska Fisheries Information Network (our version of ACCSP). These are both Oracle databases but require different logins and different network connections. To get an AFSC account, your supervisor will need to submit a helpdesk request. To get an AKFIN account, you will need to contact Bob Ryznar at Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (RRyznar@psmfc.org). With Bob, specify that youd like access via both Answers (online GUI) and SQL (its two different accounts). Before getting your accounts, you will need to get on the signers list which gives you access to confidential data. Sign both the federal and state ones which will give you full access to most things in AKFIN (including fish tickets). Contact Obren Davis at the AKRO to get the paperwork. This will not give you access to VMS data. Thats a separate process. CRITICAL: If you mess up your password in the AFSC database 3 times, your account is locked and you need the admin to reset you. Seriously. Its a pain. You have to change your password every three months. Easy to change in sql developer. Recommended: have IT load SQLDeveloper on computer. todo: add examples of changing in sql developer You will need to have IT install the Oracle odbc driver. Take the code chunks below (AFSC and AKFIN) and copy and paste them into a blank text document and save that document as tnsnames.ora. Give this .ora file to the IT person when they are setting up your account. afsc = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = raja.afsc.noaa.gov)(PORT = 1521)) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = afscp1) ) ) akfin = (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = akfindb.psmfc.org)(PORT = 2045)) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = akfin.psmfc.org) ) ) Some simple terminology for when you are communicating with the AKFIN folks. AKFIN is the database. The schema is essentially like a folder and inside of it are all the tables. 3.2 Confidentiality Some data we just arent permitted to share 3.2.1 Handling confidential data on GitHub 3.2.1.1 Easy method Use .gitignore and keep any confidential files from being pushed to github. 3.2.1.2 Local commit but not yet pushed to GitHUb In this scenario you have accidentally committed the wrong files to Git, but havent pushed the commit to GitHub. There are several ways to undo a series of commits. The method you choose depends upon the desired outcome: Undo commit and keep all files staged: git reset --soft HEAD^ Undo commit and unstage all files: git reset HEAD^ Undo last 3 commits and unstage all files: git reset HEAD~3 Undo the commit and completely remove all changes: git reset --hard HEAD^ Generally speaking you will want to use git reset HEAD^. 3.2.1.3 Accidentally pushed to GitHUb 3.3 Bering Sea Stratum numbers in the AKFIN tables designate different levels of data grouping. These designations are different for the different surveys (EBS slope vs EBS shelf). Given that these groupings are made at different levels, care should be taken not to sum values over all strata because this can duplicate data. 3.3.1 EBS SLOPE STRATUM DESIGNATIONS: Strata include (1:6, 11:15, 21:25, 31:35, 41:45, 5:55, 61:65, 999999). For 1-digit strata, the digit designates the Canyons ordered 1 - 6 , south to north, as follows: 1 - Bering Canyon 2 - Pribilof Canyon 3 - Inter Pribilof-Zhemchug 4 - Zhemchug Canyon 5 - Inter Zhemchug-Pervenets 6 - Navarin/Pervenets Canyons For 2-digit strata, the 1st digit designates the slope Canyon as above, and the 2nd digit designates the depth zone grouped into 200 m ranges as follows: 2nd digit: 200-400 m depth zone 400-600 m depth zone 600-800 m depth zone 800-1000 mdepth zone 1000-1200 m depth zone Thus, for example: Stratum 1 = Bering Canyon, all depths within that Canyon Stratum 2 = Pribilof Canyon, all depths within that Canyon Stratum 11 = Bering Canyon at depths of 200-400 m Stratum 65 = Navarin/Pervenets Canyons at depths of 1000-1200 m Finally, there is a combined overall Stratum designation: 999999 = all Canyons over all depth zones Thus, biomass for stratum=999999 is the same as the sum of biomass for strata 1+2+3+4+5+6, or the sum of biomass for strata (11+12+13+14+15+21+22+23+24+25+31+32+33+34+35+41+42+43+44+45+51+52+53+54+55+61+62+63+64+65). 3.3.2 EBS SHELF STRATUM DESIGNATIONS: Strata include (1:10, 20, 31, 32, 41:43, 50, 61, 62, 82, 90, 100, 200, 300, 999). Please refer to the stratum map for location of strata. Strata 10, 20, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 50, 61, 62, 82, 90 are the core strata within which biomass and population are computed. The other strata (1:9, 100, 200, 300, 999) are various summations of the core strata, as follows: 10 20 31+32 41+42+43 50 61+62 82 90 100 = depth zone &lt;50 m (=strata 1+2; or 10+20) 200 = depth zone 50-100 m (=strata 3+4+8; or 31+32+41+42+43+82) 300 = depth zone 100-200 m (=strata 5+6+9; or 50+61+90) 999 = overall combined (all strata = 1+2+3+4+5+6+8+9; or 10+20+31+32+41+42+43+50+61+62+82+90) 3.4 Aleutian Islands 3.5 Gulf of Alaska "],["groundfish-safe-report-chapters.html", "Chapter 4 Groundfish SAFE Report Chapters 4.1 Introduction 4.2 September SAFE Report Guidelines 4.3 November SAFE Report Guidelines", " Chapter 4 Groundfish SAFE Report Chapters 4.1 Introduction The BSAI and GOA Groundfish FMPs require that separate drafts of the SAFE reports be produced each year in time for the October and December meetings of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. These drafts are assembled at meetings of the Groundfish Plan Teams held in September and November. To ensure adequate time for internal review of stock assessments, a pair of due dates will be established annually. These due dates typically will precede the respective Plan Team meetings by two to three weeks. The following guidelines govern the preparation of individual stock assessment chapters for the two drafts. Please note that the Plan Teams expect sufficient documentation for any potential action item to be provided at least 7 days prior to the start of the meeting. If exceptional circumstances make it impossible to meet this deadline, the Teams expect such documentation to be provided as soon as possible, and in no case later than 5:00 p.m. on the day before the presentation is to be given. 4.2 September SAFE Report Guidelines It is not always necessary to produce a chapter for the September SAFE report. In general, it is assumed that authors will be able to discern whether any changes in the stock assessment resulting from incorporation of the available new information are substantial enough to require review by the Plan Teams and SSC. Authors are strongly encouraged to collect and analyze new information prior to the relevant due date to ensure that the implications of such information are thoroughly evaluated. A chapter may not be necessary for the September SAFE report if the above conditions do not apply, if no new information is available, or if preliminary analyses of new information fail to indicate any substantial changes from the previous assessment. If a stock is being considered for upgrading to Tiers 1-3, or if a new assessment model or analysis is being recommended, a chapter should be produced that provides enough information for the Plan Team(s) to make a decision about what new models or analyses should be included in the November assessment. In all cases, consideration should be given to all applicable SSC and Plan Team comments from the previous assessment(s). Chapters should be submitted by the relevant due date. 4.3 November SAFE Report Guidelines A chapter should be produced for the November SAFE report in all cases except for stocks or stock complexes that the AFSC, after consultation with the Plan Teams and SSC, has placed on a biennial assessment cycle. The chapter should include all sections listed in the Outline of SAFE Report Chapters below. The Outline is intended to provide a consistent structure and logical flow for stock assessments conducted at the AFSC for the groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and GOA. Some variation from this outline is permissible if warranted by limitations of data or other extenuating circumstance. However, it is particularly important that all of the items listed under Projections and Harvest Alternatives be included to the maximum extent possible, in that many of these are critical to the fishery management process. Consideration should be given to all applicable SSC and Plan Team comments from the previous assessment(s). Chapters should be submitted by the relevant due date. Please omit any headers, page numbers, and footers on the version of drafts submitted for dissemination to the Plan Teams or Council. They will be added afterwards. Use of section heading styles in Word (heading 1, heading 2, etc.) and normal style (11 point times new roman) for main text is encouraged. Please allow 1 inch margins (72 points) and be sure the tables or figures dont overlap the margins. Please use the chapter numbers as they appear in the tasking memo. SAFE chapters should be outlined as follows: 4.3.1 Title Please use the following convention: Assessment of the Myfish stock in the Gulf of Alaska for single-stock assessments and Assessment of the Myfish stock complex in the Gulf of Alaska for multi-stock assessments (replacing italicized text appropriately). 4.3.2 Executive Summary 4.3.2.1 Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs List of changes (if any) in the input data, including estimated catches assumed for the current year and projected catches for current year + 1 and current year + 2. List of changes (if any) in the assessment methodology. This is one of the most important sections of the SAFE report. Common mistakes in this section include: 1) listing something that has not changed, and 2) not listing something that has changed. Summary of Results Text table showing M; recommended Tier; projected total biomass (give age range); female spawning biomass; equilibrium female spawning biomass values for B0 and BMSY (Tier 1 only) or B100%, B40%, and B35% (Tier 3 only); FOFL; the maximum allowable value for FABC; the recommended value for FABC; OFL; the maximum allowable ABC, and the recommended ABC. State whether the stock or complex is being subjected to overfishing, is currently overfished, or is approaching a condition of being overfished. Compare all of the above to the corresponding values from last years final assessment (or final specifications, if different from the assessment values). Tier-specific templates for this table are in development. A brief discussion of substantial changes in results from last year may be included if it helps explain the summary table. 4.3.2.2 Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments on Assessments in General Responses to SSC and Plan Team comments on assessments in general (for each comment that is addressed in the main text, list comment, and reference the section where it is discussed). If the SSC or Plan Team did not make any comments on assessments in general, say so. 4.3.2.3 Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this Assessment Responses to SSC and Plan Team comments specific to this assessment (for each comment that is addressed in the main text, list comment and reference the section where it is discussed). If the SSC or Plan Team did not make any comments specific to this assessment, say so. 4.3.3 Introduction Scientific name Description of general biology and distribution Description of key life history characteristics specific to stock assessments (e.g., special features of reproductive biology) Evidence of stock structure, if any 4.3.4 Fishery Brief description of fishery history Description of management measures/unit(s) Management history (including key changes which may have influenced assessment procedures; selectivity of commercial fishing gear; or distribution of catch by gear, area, or season. Include a table of total catch, total ABC, total OFL, and total TAC, and associated management measures Description of the current directed fishery (including gear types, seasons, major fishing locations) Description of effort and CPUE Information on discards of this stock or stock complex (from directed fishery for this stock or stock complex) 4.3.5 Data (If the data for any particular component described here are so voluminous that the corresponding tables would comprise more than 2 pages, the tables may be placed on a website referenced in the chapter.) For Tiers 1-3, insert a text table summarizing the data used in the assessment model (source, type, years included). The following is a typical example: Source Data Years NMFS groundfish survey Survey biomass 1984-1999 (triennial), 2001-2013 (biennial) Age Composition 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 U.S. trawl fisheries Catch 1961-2013 Age composition 1990,1998-2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010 Length composition 1963-1977, 1991-1997 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
